# Smart Medicine Reminder System using LPC2148(Proteus)

## Project Description
The Smart Medicine Reminder System is an embedded system project built using the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller. It helps users manage medication schedules by providing timely reminders using an RTC-based alert system. The project uses a 16×2 LCD for display, a keypad for setting medicine timings, and buzzer & LED indicators for alerts. The system ensures users never miss their medication schedule. The entire project is simulated in Proteus for academic and learning purposes.
